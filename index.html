                <p>Hi, I'm Camille and I'm a first-year Computer Engineering major. In high school, I organized an activity where students created learning resources digitally (eg. creating illustrated storybooks online), and partnered with a non-profit to distribute these. Outside of classes, I like trying new foods, going to the gym (trying to), and hanging out with friends.</p>
